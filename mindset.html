        <h2>establishing routine in quarantine with mindset +</h2>

    <div class = "description">
        <p>This past summer, I participated in a design sprint at Columbia that followed Google’s design sprint method. My group and I focused on how we could help people develop routines during quarantine and found that focusing on “small steps” and rewards on a task-to-task basis was crucial. We prototyped an app called Mindset +, where the user can create a pet to take care of as they complete their tasks through reflection and small steps. </p>
