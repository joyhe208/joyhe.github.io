        <p id = "bioTxt">Hello! I'm Joy, and I'm a first-year engineering student at Columbia. I'm interested in applied math, computer science, and sociology. Outside of academics, I love running long distances, drinking coffee, embroidering, and listening to way too much music (85, 684 minutes in 2020). At Columbia, I am taking Data Structures in Java, Multivariable Calculus, and Accelerated Physics. Next semester, I will be taking Advanced Programming, Discrete Math, Ordinary DiffEqs, and Accelerated Physics. I am also involved in various Christian ministries. I am on the blog team for the Columbia Witness, which is the Christian publication on campus, and I'm on the board for the Veritas Forum, where we host discussions on life's greatest philosophical and moral questions. I am also in the Engineers without Borders Ghana Tech Team. </p>
