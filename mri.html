        <h2>the feasibility of a hand-held mri device</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "description">
        <p>The summer of 2019, I interned at Draper Labs and worked on a project with three other high school students. Our job was to verify the feasibility of a hand-held MRI device that uses permanent magnets rather than electromagnets, making the device more portable and accessible to resource-scarce communities. With my knowledge of magnetic fields and trigonometry, I designed an octagonal Halbach cylinder in SolidWorks that had a uniform magnetic field inside of it. I then used Arduino sensors and Matlab to measure and plot the field so we could analyze its homogeneity (extremely important in MRIs) and strength. We found that the Halbach cylinder did indeed have a homogenous, uniform field that was considerably strong for a cylinder with only 8 magnets. We passed our findings and building process on to our advisor and his team, so that in the future, they can build a Halbach cylinder with a larger number of magnets.</p>
